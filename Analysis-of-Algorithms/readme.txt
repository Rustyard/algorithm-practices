Three problems in this section:
1. 3-Sum in quadratic time
2. search in a bitonic array
    solved in ~3lgn, but can be better with ~2lgn (no finding max value)
3. egg drop
    Version 0: easy
    Version 1: easy
    Version 2: slow start + binary search
    Version 3: solved in 2*sqrt(n), but can be better with sqrt(2*n)? (but how?)
    Version 4: solved with 1,4,9,...,k^2 slow start, the aim is 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(T), don't know how.
