# An algorithm for solving dynamic connectivity problems
homework percolation (89/100)

**NOTE 1**: according to the [FAQ](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/faq.php), my implementation got at least one thing wrong: not using provided `WeightedQuickUnionUF.java` but used my own implementation of `QuickUnion` written inside of the `Percolation.java`, which caused the timing test not working (all failed).

**NOTE 2**: from FAQ: 
> **It's OK to use an extra row and/or column to deal with the 1-based indexing of the percolation grid.** Though it is slightly inefficient, it's fine to use arrays or unionâ€“find objects that are slightly larger than strictly necessary. Doing this results in cleaner code at the cost of slightly greater memory usage.

See more in the assignment FAQ: I probably should rewrite the whole percolation program later...
