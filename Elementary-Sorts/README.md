# Elementary Sorts

We went through these sort methods:

1. Selection sort
    - `~1/2 N^2` on all cases (**quadratic**)
    - not going to implement here
2. Insertion sort
    - `~1/4 N^2` compares, `~1/4 N^2` exchanges, on average (**quadratic**)
    - N-1 compares and 0 exchanges, on the best case
    - `~1/2 N^2` compares, `~1/2 N^2` exchanges, on the worst case (slower than selection sort)
    - 2 times quicker than selection sort, on average
    - **linear for partially sorted arrays**
    - not going to implement here
3. Shell sort
4.
