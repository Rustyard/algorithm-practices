## A friendly reminder

When your IDE failed to fetch/push things, try to do these:

```
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
git config --global http.sslVerify "false"
```

This problem only happens ***somewhere in the world***, and I live there. So I wrote these to remind myself.
